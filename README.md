## Project

This project simulates a purchase process in a web store, the React Fake Store.
I used the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to fetch and mock data.

### Requirements and functionalities

**Rendering dinamic informations:**

- Application creates a menu list based on products categories;
- Application show indicators like: amount products on cart list, and witch category is selected.
- Application allows to order products by price: low to high and vice versa;
- In the **Cart** section, the application allows increment and decrement the product amount as well delete a product from cart;
- In the **Cart** section, the application calculates and updates the values dinamically;
- Application handles the fact that the cart is empty;
- It is possible to return to buy more products during cart manipulation.

**UI/UX aspects:**

- Users can view all products or products by category;
- There are functions and elements to allow fluid navigation between sections;

## Layout

I used Figma to build design.

## Learn

It was a big challenge to build this application using React.

This project is not yet complete. I like to refactor my designs as I gain more knowledge.
